# 0x03. Log Parsing

- For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:


# Concepts Needed:
1. File I/O in Python:

    - Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
    - [Python Input and Output](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/f7U2MDsBT_rd9AfUUaqVnQ)
2. Signal Handling in Python:

    - Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
    - [Python Signal Handling](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1nDqPJe80rSD-NMulzjJBw)
3. Data Processing:

    - Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
    - Aggregating data to compute summaries.
4. Regular Expressions:

    - Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
    - [Python Regular Expressions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/ZsD-YLisfaHFeMT_sZxX1Q)
5. Dictionaries in Python:

    - Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
    - [Python Dictionaries](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/JM-RpavKkb8yanxWEnNYJw)
6. Exception Handling:

    - Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
    - [Python Exceptions](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/OA2PlryrYA2gyCCKIsdgUw)


- By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
