# Rotate 2D Matrix Task

- For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

## Concepts Needed:
**Matrix Representation in Python:**

  - Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
  - Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
**In-place Operations:**

  - Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
  - The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
**Matrix Transposition:**

  - Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
  - Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
**Reversing Rows in a Matrix:**

  - Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
**Nested Loops:**

  - Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
  - Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
## Resources:
**Python Official Documentation:**

  - [More on Lists](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/0ORj179giGhGe8jpcxBkXg)
**GeeksforGeeks Articles:**

  - [Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/9T8w4mtiIIRDtfLSmEmrLA)
  - [Transpose a matrix in Single line in Python](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/JdIFvtej2hMW-Wd9ABHMOA)
**TutorialsPoint:**

  - [Python Lists](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/rFmzUTpaLGqDXjGA6D9eYw) for basics of list manipulation in Python.
- By understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be able to approach the problem methodically, first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This project not only tests your ability to manipulate 2D matrices but also challenges you to think about optimizing your solution to operate in-place, thus improving their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills in Python.
